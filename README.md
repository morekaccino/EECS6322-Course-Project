## Abstract
This proposal discusses the key contribution of the
paper titled ”On the Resiliency of Power and Gas Integration
Resources Against Cyber Attacks.” The paper’s relationship with
the EECS6322 course is also emphasized. The paper proposes
a cybersecurity framework that uses machine learning, partic-
ularly neural networks, to defend against cyberattacks. Both
the information received from field sensors and the information
shared between power utilities and control panels are protected.
Convolutional neural networks and wavelet transforms were used
to safeguard primary field measurements, while an unsupervised
classification neural network was used to detect the exact oper-
ation point of the control signals shared from the power utility.
The output of the unsupervised neural network was then utilized
by a second neural network to determine the exact operation
point and detect any potential cyberattacks in the power utility’s
information.
